# IoT Based Cattle Farm Management System

### (N.B: I am doing this project for one of my master's course)

Cattle farming is the way of raising livestock from the prenatal period until they become ready to be eaten or milked. A dairy farmer generally has a barn for his livestock and a farm for his cattle to graze on. Cattle farmers raise cattle to provide milk for their households as well as revenue distribution. As an agricultural country, the vast majority of the people of Bangladesh directly depend upon their farms for survival. Our project aim is to make these cattle farming easier. We will develop a web application where farmers can register themselves and make their profile, they can add their cow details. Unfortunately, daily animal condition monitoring is difficult, particularly if someone has a large farm, and most of the farmers don’t have enough employees to track and observe animal’s health conditions. This IoT-based system for dairy cows can easily collect information through sensors and upload the data in the application.

**Technology Used:** React JS, MongoDB, Node for the web application, sensors for the hardware implementation.
